To fix this, go to `Settings > Language & Region` and click \"Add Language...\". Chose another language. Then, switch back to your preferred language.\n\nMake sure your app hash matches the one that you received from running the \"Pocket Poster Helper\" button in Nugget's settings.\nIf this is an error with PosterBoard, use the fallback shortcut by going to Pocket Poster's settings, and clicking \"Download Fallback Shortcut\". Run it, and try applying again.\nIf these fixes still don't work for you, check your `.tendies` file. It could be misconfigured. Try using it on your pc, or contacting the creator."
